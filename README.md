# A-hybrid-model-including-independent-component-analysis-and-neural-network-for-forecasting

Independent component analysis (ICA) is used to separate blind sources of data. In fact, independent component analysis converts complicated and dependent variables to independent variables whose prediction would be easier. Then the idea of this research is to use a hybrid model including ICA and neural network to forecast data. In complicated and dependent data, ICA can first be used as a technique to recognize the independent source of data and then use different models like neural networks to forecast independent data. The main purpose of this research is to investigate the following research questions:

1. Evaluate and compare the performance of different hybrid model to forecast temperature in Sweden.

2. Apply this model to forecast other Applications (financial dataset) if applicable.

3. Adopting algorithms to spark framework to make them more efficient.
